            <p>Django Reinhardt was a Belgian-French jazz musician and composer of Romani-Gypsy origins. He is considered to be one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time. He was the first major jazz talent to emerge from Europe and remains the most significant. </p>
            <p>His jazz group, Quintette du Hot Club de France, formed in 1934 with Stéphane Grappelli, was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and briefly toured the United States with Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1946.</p>
            <p>His most popular compositions include <a href="https://youtu.be/DL5aUq1_7N0" target="_blank">Minor Swing</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/g8mOH5xchIU" target="_blank">Manoir de mes rêves</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/kCMSOvAsdBA" target="_blank">Douce Ambiance</a> among many others.</p>
            <p>His career spanned over the WWII period in Nazi-occupied France where jazz musicians were targetted by the Nazi regime which considered jazz to be an "inferior" and "un-German" form of music. </p>
            <p>In addition, his Romani origins also put him in a hazardous situation. During the Holocaust, between 600,000 and 1.5 million Romani people were killed in concentration camps. However despite such obstacles his career still thrived due to popularity of his music among ordinary German soldiers and he managed to avoid getting sent to concentration camp and survive the war.</p>
            <p>Despite his physical disability, he played mainly using his index and middle fingers, and invented a distinctive style of jazz guitar. Many musicians have cited him as a major influence. Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia and Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, both of whom lost fingers in accidents, were inspired by Reinhardt's example of becoming an accomplished guitar player despite his injuries.</p>
